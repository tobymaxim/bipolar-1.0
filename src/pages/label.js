    <p>The full EP "STFU" by IZZI BIZZI with remixes by TOBIAS HALL, RASVAL & ONES. is now available on Bandcamp! We were lucky to have a bunch of dedicated Berlin based artists team up to create an official music video to the original version of ‚STFU‘ to visualize the track’s message. The goal was to give artists a platform to create and showcase their work – the video is the result of joint forces, shared dedication and a deeply rooted love for music, techno and the arts. Show your love by listening, watching, liking and sharing the music and video!</p>
